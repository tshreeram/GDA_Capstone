#done in Tableau ( could've used R too but I'm not that proficient yet also since Tableau is gui not code)

#notes
#my choice of dataset is wrong, 2018 dataset doesn't prove much.
#I'm not that proficient in R yet which sucks but I'll get there hopefully
#Also I could've just used a rmd instead of this wasted time T_T
